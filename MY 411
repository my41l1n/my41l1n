When looking at the cost of your payday loan, using the APR allows you to get a more accurate estimate of the loan’s costs as well as compare costs across different credit products, so you can decide which one works best for your situation.

To calculate the APR, the interest rate and fees are compared to the amount you borrow and the number of days of the loan, then divided by 365 (one year). For example, if your payday lender were to charge you a $15 fee once per year for every $100 borrowed, that would be a simple interest rate of 15 percent. But if you’re required to repay the loan in two weeks, that 15-percent finance charge equates to an APR of almost 400 percent because of the very short term.
